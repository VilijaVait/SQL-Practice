/* Query: Your boss is worried about a few of the sales representatives. He wants a report to see the last time each one of them had an order. Please show the order id, the employee last name, the employee first name, the date of the order, and the city the order was shipped to. But he doesn't want to see every order, just the most recent order for each employee. Thanks!*/

/* my version*/

SELECT orders.orderID, LastName, FirstName, orders.OrderDate, orders.ShipCity
FROM orders
INNER JOIN employees ON 1=1
    AND employees.EmployeeID = orders.EmployeeID

/*Condition for only those rows to be selected where order date is the latest
one for each given employee, i.e. testing for last order date and employee pairs */

WHERE EXISTS

        FROM orders
        GROUP BY orders.employeeID) AS last_orders
    WHERE orders.EmployeeID = last_orders.EmployeeID AND orders.OrderDate = last_orders.max_OrderDate);


/*answer suggested by the course*/
/*creates a "mirror" table for orders table,
and then finds the latest order date according by comparing the two tables*/
